In order for existing projects to adopt SIT, currently
they'd have to abandon their existing issue tracker,
which is not a great course of action, especially for
an active project.

And there is a tool that solves this (at least for GitHub
projects), sit-import, but it is a separate project that
is not developed in sync with issue-tracking.

Solution: merge it in

When listing issues, all of them are rendered at once. This might have
performance implications, especially when listing a larger number of
issues (especially considering that we don't have pagination at the
moment).

Solution: use "virtual infinite list" component (iron-list) to render
enough issues to fill the viewport.

As a side note, the elevation of the paper-cards was changed to zero,
because with iron-list, there was an unfortunate visual "glitch" where
once in a while a border between two items was thicker that others. I
assume this was happening precisely because of the rendering technique.
Elevation set to zero removed borders altogether. I think it actually
looks better and lighter this way anyway.

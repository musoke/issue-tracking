More specifically, the summary message's instructions are
shown without leading hash signs (#) and such commented out
lines are not subsequently removed.

Similarly, while details instructions are prepended with hash
signs, those are not subsequently removed.

Solution: enforce use of regular expressions in sed with -E

(For some reason, GNU sed didn't need -E (POSIX) or -r to work)

Apparently, it is impossible to specify some more involved
JMESPath expressions, for example, ones that would contain
`?contains` or a slash in them.

Solution: make sure both frontend use percent encoding

The reason for this malfunction is that, firstly, the frontend part
didn't encode the URL components being 1) sent to the server 2) updated
in the location of the page.

Secondly, the backend's library for handling HTTP (rouille) eagerly
decoded URLs thus rendering it impossible to match on these values
as `?` or `/` would trigger stops. A forked version of roulle is used
now. If the [pull request](https://github.com/tomaka/rouille/pull/173)
will be accepted, can switch back at that time.

This creates an uncertainty in the interface (there's no "Loading"
indication) and extremely large code blocks (such as big patches)
hang browser for awhile.

Proposed ways to mitigate issues (choose some or all?):

1. Adding a "Loading" indicator
2. Using Web Workers to highlight
3. Limiting the size of a code block that we can show
4. Showing plain (non-highlighted) code first‚èé

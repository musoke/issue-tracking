It keeps complaining about trying to load `prims-.js` (which is returned
as an HTML file, because whatever can't be found is routed to
/index.html to enable Single Page Application experience)

Solution: make sure this requets never happens

It only happens because at some point `lang` might be an empty
string and that empty string gets into the URL.

Don't do the request if `lang` is empty.

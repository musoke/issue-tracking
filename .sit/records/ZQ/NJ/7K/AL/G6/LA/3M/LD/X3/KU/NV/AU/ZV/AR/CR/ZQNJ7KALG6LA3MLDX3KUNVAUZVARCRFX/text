Scenario:

1. Open an issue
2. Scroll to the bottom
3. Press "Comment" (or "Comment and close")

Outcome: silence and an error in console.log (HTTP 500 for "Comment" and "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'append' of undefined" for "Comment and close")

Proposed solutions: 

1. Disable commenting buttons unless there's text to comment with
2. Submit actual empty comments
2.1. Disabling commenting but enable commenting and closing and do just closing if "Comment and close" was clicked.

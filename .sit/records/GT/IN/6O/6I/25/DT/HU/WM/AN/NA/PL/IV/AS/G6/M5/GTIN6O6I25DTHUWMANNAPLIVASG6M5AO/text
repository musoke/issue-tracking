In certain cases (for example, if there was more than one
patch) mr-merge fails to return to the previous branch and
perform a merge.

Solution: try to guess the previous branch only if resuming
a merge.

I suspect that it will only be functional in the simplest case
of a single patch, so it'll have to be fixed down the road.

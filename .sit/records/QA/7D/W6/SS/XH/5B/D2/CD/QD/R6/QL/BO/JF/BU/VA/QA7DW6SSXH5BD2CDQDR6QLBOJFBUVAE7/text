Scenario:

1. Open an issue
2. Start typing a comment at the bottom
3. Go back to the list of issues
4. Open another issue
5. Scroll down

Outcome: see that the comment you started typing is there.

Expected outcome: see no comment draft.

Proposed solution: either a) clean the draft during navigation/re-rendering or b) save the draft on a per-issue basis, perhaps in a local storage.

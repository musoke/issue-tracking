When a merge request is failed, the user is left
with the task of re-applying the patch and finishing
the merging/closure of the issue. This is not a great
user experience.

Solution: enable three-way merge to allow manual resolution of the
conflict and detect if the script is called from a merge branch and
pick it up from where it was left, assuming that the changes were done.

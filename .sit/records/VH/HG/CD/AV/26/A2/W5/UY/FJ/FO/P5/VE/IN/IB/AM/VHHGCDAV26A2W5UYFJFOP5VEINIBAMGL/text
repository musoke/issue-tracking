Over a slower connection (or on a slower computer) when an issue is being opened, one can spot that the word "on" appears first. This is quite confusion.

The reason why it happens is because this word is part of the template:

```html
 <small>[[ view.authors ]] on <from-now use-absolute time="[[ time ]]" format="MMM Do YYYY HH:mm"></from-now></small>
```

Problem is, these variables in templates aren't available at the time of rendering as they are obtained through instances of the `iron-ajax` element.

I am not yet sure what would be the best solution for this, but I think it'd be great to have smoother rendering.
